        <h4 id="description">Description</h4>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, climate crisis, regional conflicts, and the war in Ukraine have altogether created severe food shortages across multiple countries in Africa. ​​More than 23 million people are experiencing extreme hunger in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, which is more than double the previous year. The ongoing war disruptions the global food supply chain, causing a surge in food prices worldwide, and now, African countries are facing the worst food crisis since 1945. This project aims to create a monitoring system for the ongoing food crisis that will identify events, policies, and other socioeconomic factors directly or indirectly linked to food insecurity in the region. We will develop tools that automatically collect relevant news reporting and extract features from texts that are predictive of future food crises. The project will contribute to the fight against world hunger by building a data-driven knowledge base.</p>
        <h3>High vs Low IPC Scores - All Countries</h3>
        <object type="text/html" data="./allcountries_ipc.html" style="width: 100%; height: 700px;"></object>
        <p>Here we have a visualization comparing the word frequencies associated with a low IPC food insecurity score (1 or 2) against the word frequencies associated with a high food insecurity score (3 or 4). No food insecurity scores of 5 were present in the dataset. It is also important to note that this visualization includes all 5 countries in its analysis. When we look at the frequent words for high and low food insecurity scores, we see some interesting patterns. For one, the top two words associated with high food insecurity scores are “farmland” and “floods”, followed shortly after on the list by “catastrophe” and “drought”, all of which are related to agriculture and disasters. While we see some agricultural words on the low food insecurity list, such as “pests”, “locusts”, and “cyclone”, these show up further down on the list. Another interesting pattern is the prevalence of words related to political unrest in the high food insecurity list; examples of this include “coup”, “d’etat”, “terrorist”, “terrorism”, and “rise”. We also see political words in the low food insecurity list, but these are mostly more conceptual words such as “authoritarian”, “totalitarian”, and “dictators”. However, it is important to note that these trends are not absolute and some exceptions are present. For example, we see a conceptual word like “corruption” on the high food insecurity list, albeit quite low. Additionally, we see words that could potentially relate to political unrest in the low food insecurity list, such as “convoys” and “siege”. Finally, when considering the confidence of this analysis, it is important to note that all of the words on this list remain fairly close to the center line between high food insecurity scores and low food insecurity scores.</p>
        <h3>All Countries Pre-Post Covid</h3>
        <object type="text/html" data="./allcountries_covid.html" style="width: 100%; height: 700px;"></object>
        <p>Here, we see all countries visualized based on their post covid frequencies on the x-axis and pre covid frequencies on the y-axis. To be considered pre covid, the articles are from before 02-01-20 and post covid articles are after the same date of 02-01-20. This date was chosen as it was the beginning of the increased transmission globally. We expect words that relate to the pandemic to be more present after the onset of the pandemic, which is seen with some words in the visualization. Namely, some of the top post covid words for all countries are "epidemics" and "rise.” We expect these words to be present. Other top post covid words such as “farmland” “floods” “displaced” “drought” and “catastrophe” relate to natural disasters and agriculture. Top pre covid words such as “convoys” “secession” “authoritarian” and “overthrow” relate to politics. This shows an interesting shift in these 5 countries' situation before and after covid. Can this shift in topic be explained by the pandemic itself, or is it a mere coincidence? Further, how do these words relate to food insecurity?</p>
        <h3>Pre Covid High vs Low IPC scores - All countries</h3>
        <p>For this visualization, we see the difference between words associated with high food insecurity and words associated with low food insecurity when examining only articles that came before the COVID-19 pandemic. One immediately interesting thing to note about this is that the words are separated in clumps. For example, there is a group of words including “clans”, “tragedy”, “convoys”, “d’etat”, “siege”, and “pests” which are all very clearly associated with low food insecurity”. When we see this. One interesting thing to note is that in this pre-COVID analysis, “coup” and “d’etat” are very clearly low food insecurity words, while a post COVID analysis shows them to be very high food insecurity words, as seen below.</p>
