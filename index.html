        <h4 id="description">Description</h4>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, climate crisis, regional conflicts, and the war in Ukraine have altogether created severe food shortages across multiple countries in Africa. ​​More than 23 million people are experiencing extreme hunger in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, which is more than double the previous year. The ongoing war disruptions the global food supply chain, causing a surge in food prices worldwide, and now, African countries are facing the worst food crisis since 1945. This project aims to create a monitoring system for the ongoing food crisis that will identify events, policies, and other socioeconomic factors directly or indirectly linked to food insecurity in the region. We will develop tools that automatically collect relevant news reporting and extract features from texts that are predictive of future food crises. The project will contribute to the fight against world hunger by building a data-driven knowledge base.</p>
        <h4 id="description">Pre v.s. Post COVID-19 Visualizations</h4>
        <p> These visualizations look into how the COVID-19 pandamic may have played a role in the food shortagecrisis in different African countries. All of these visualizations are plotted with post-Covid frequent words on the X-axis and pre-Covid frequent words on the Y-axis. In general, it is hard to discern concretely if any words are more relevant post-pandemic than pre-pandemic. Some countries do have interesting relationships to take note of. </p>
        <h3 id="visualization">Senegal</h3>
        <object type="text/html" data="./Senegal.html" style="width: 100%; height: 700px;"></object>
        <p>Senegal has some interesting terms that show significance when comparing before and after Covid. Words that are seen more frequently post-pandemic are: “epidemics” “coup” “carbon” and “tragedy.” In this context, “epidemics” makes the most intuitive sense. </p>
        <h3 id="visualization">Guinea</h3>
        <object type="text/html" data="./Guinea.html" style="width: 100%; height: 700px;"></object>
        <h3 id="visualization">Burkina Faso</h3>
        <object type="text/html" data="./BurkinaFaso.html" style="width: 100%; height: 700px;"></object>
        <p>For Burkina Faso, “blockade” is the only word seen significantly more post-pandemic.</p>
        <h3 id="visualization">Mali</h3>
        <object type="text/html" data="./Mali.html" style="width: 100%; height: 700px;"></object>
        <p>For Mali, the only real word of note is “epidemics” again with “blockade” “locusts” and “cyclone” seen slightly more post-pandemic.</p>
        <h3 id="visualization">Niger</h3>
        <object type="text/html" data="./Niger.html" style="width: 100%; height: 700px;"></object>
        <p>For Niger, the distribution is a lot less linear, showing greater differences for term frequencies between the two time periods. Lots of words are seen more frequently post-pandemic such as farmland, displaced, siege, and tragedy. </p>
        <h3 id="visualization">All Countries</h3>
